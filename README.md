Unofficial Index of Northampton Government Meeting Videos and Hopefully Eventually Minutes

Created and managed by Ward 6 City Councilor Christopher Stratton chris4council6@gmail.com

This repository and page are created out of a personal and civic interest in facilitating ready access to Northampton's public process and political history.

To date, no city IT or resources have been used in its creation beyond those available to the public on the city website.   It is my hope that at some point a derivative of this index might make it onto the city website, but at present this is a personal project, me speaking as a politician, and me advocating for open government as the elected representative of Ward 6.

Northampton's meeting videos are hosted on youtube by Northampton Open Media which has a strict neutrality policy.   I am in conversation with them about this indexing project, as I had originally thought it might require some sort of data export, but it turned out that I was able to collect this data from public interfaces without any actual assistance.  Working on this index has uncovered a few videos with typos in their dates, etc and those issues are being submitted back to help their curation.   

Comment, feedback, issue tracker, pull request etc policy:

In keeping with the social media policy of Northampton's city government overall (https://www.northamptonma.gov/2575/Policies) I reserve the right to remove at my sole discretion comments and submission not topically related to the particular topic being commented upon; profane language or content; discourteous communication including personal attacks on an individual’s character or appearance; content that promotes, fosters or perpetuates discrimination based on any protected class; sexual content or links to sexual content; solicitations of commerce; conduct or encouragement of illegal activity; information that may tend to compromise the safety or security of the public or public systems; content that violates legal ownership interests of another party; or false or misleading information regarding city services or government.

In practical terms, what this means is that I will delete/decline submissions or feedback which appear to be political commentary rather than technical inssues with or contributions to this indexing effort.
